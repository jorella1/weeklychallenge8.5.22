""" Create a function that will recursively count the number of digits of a number. 
Conversion of the number to a string is not allowed, thus, the approach is recursive.

Examples
digits_count(4666) ➞ 4
digits_count(544) ➞ 3
digits_count(121317) ➞ 6
digits_count(0) ➞ 1
digits_count(12345) ➞ 5

digits_count(1289396387328) ➞ 13
Notes

All inputs are integers but some are in exponential form, deal with it accordingly.
You are expected to come up with a solution using the concept of recursion or the so-called recursive approach. """
